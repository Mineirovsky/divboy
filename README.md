## Step sequencer for Game BoyÂ® Advance

This aims to be a complete step sequencer to take advantage of the audio
capabilities of the GBA to help musicians achieve that vintage colour

### Main features
The main features will be:
- Up to 64 steps per part
- Parts can be sequenced to compose a whole song
- Songs can be stored for calling later
- Polyrhythmics!

It's unclear if it's feasible at the moment, but some kind of synth may be
developed to use PCM capabilities

### Goals
- Comprehensible interface
- Satisfatory and optimal UX, given the fact the GBA has few buttons
